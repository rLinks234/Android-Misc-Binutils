This folder contains various executables that create or analyze bmf files.

bmf stands for **B**it**M**ap **F**ont.

It's simply some file format I've used while creating text rendering demos for OpenGL. It depends on FreeType2 for font rasterization.

Check out bmfwriter to see how the file is created. The other files simply exist as analyzers for existing .bmf files.

This is no longer maintained, but I'm keeping it just for reference and as a proof of concept.
